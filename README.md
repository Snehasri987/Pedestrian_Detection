# Pedestrian Detection System using OpenCV

## Introduction
The Pedestrian Detection System uses OpenCV to identify and track pedestrians in real-time. This project leverages computer vision techniques to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of detecting pedestrians.

## Features
- Real-time pedestrian detection
- High accuracy with minimal false positives
- Customizable detection parameters
- Easy-to-integrate code

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/pedestrian-detection.git
    ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```
    cd pedestrian-detection
    ```
2. Run the detection script:
    ```
    python detect_pedestrians.py
    ```

## Example
Insert example images or GIFs of the system in action.
